# Quickstart

## Getting started

1. Install packages

```cmd
yarn install
```

2. Start dev environment

```cmd
yarn run dev
```

This will start a local [bos-workspace](https://github.com/NEARBuilders/bos-workspace) gateway at [127.0.0.1:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080) which will render your local widgets. The entry point for this app is [pokethe.near/widget/Index](http://127.0.0.1:8080/pokethe.near/widget/Index)
